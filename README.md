# Linear-Regression-Projects
In this project, I have implemented a linear regression model from scratch without relying on external libraries. Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning, and by building it using mathematical formulas and coding it entirely on my own, I aimed to deepen my understanding of the underlying principles.
